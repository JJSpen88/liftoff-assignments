For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A stock dividend tracking app that assists you in reinvesting your dividends more effectively by suggesting which stock to reinvest in based on your portfolio allocation, and soonest record date. By reinvesting in the soonest record date you can compound your cash flow faster giving you more reinvestable cash sooner, and by reinvesting in positions that are under weight, you can spread portfolio risk. Notifications can be sent to the user if one of their stocks has a significant dip so they can take advantage of the sale. This app is designed for long term buy and hold dividend investing, not swing or day trading. It will require manual entry for amount of shares and ticker symbols in the portfolio because it would be a huge under taking to provide multiple API's for each brokerage account, not to mention the additional security required to protect the users information if the app has direct access to their brokerage.
### Features
1. Be able to enter a stock by the ticker symbol and amount of shares owned.
2. Be able to update the amount of shares owned and add new positions.
3. Track the percentage of your portfolio per stock by the amount of shares x share price.
4. Be able to track record, ex-dividend, and payout dates.
5. Send (push) notification when a stocks record date is coming within the next few days.
6. Send notification when a stock price moves down significantly to take advantage of buying opportunities. (3-5%)
### Technologies
Javascript
Angular / React
NodeJS
### What I'll Have to Learn
React or refresh myself on Angular. Would prefer to use React because it could translate to React native later on to scale from webapp to mobile app.
Integrate a stock information API. (This could prove to be difficult simply because a lot of these APIs have a subscription cost)
